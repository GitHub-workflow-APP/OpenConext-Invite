# Openconext-Invite

## Intro

This application provides an application to send email invites to users.
Once the invite is accepted, the new user roles can be sent to external systems
by [SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.1), graph API
or email (ticketing system). Also a
[VOOT](https://wiki.geant.org/display/gn3pjra3/VOOT+specifications) provider is
available for publishing the users' memberships.

To test and demonstrate the application, an example client application is available.
